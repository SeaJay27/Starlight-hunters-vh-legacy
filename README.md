Based on the YT series Starlight Hunters where I play through all the VH versions, this is Legacy VH. 

This series goes through different kinds of Vault Hunters, Vault Hunters Legacy, Vault hunters 2 and Wolds Vaults (VH3). This is where we take the world that we're playing on and with the thought of upgrading from 1.16.3 to 1.18.2, making sure our base is ready for whatever is to come. Also this series makes use of TwitchSpawn which allows for viewers on twitch to troll me and also help me!

The goal is not easy to goal post;
VH Legacy - Obtain all 16 Artifacts
VH2 - Obtain 25 artifacts and beat the Final Vault
Wolds - Obtain 25 artifacts and obtain the platinum trophy in full mythic gear


This will be updated with what gets changed within the pack, quite a lot of the stuff for this version is config and recipies related to the_vault mod, as well as potential new mods to help with performance.
